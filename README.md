# multi-threading-LPC17xx
This repo builds on LPC1769 LPCXpresso board.

I implemented this because I wanted to see my theory works in real. This is not a fully implemented multi threading because it misses some important features like: thread ID, storing the return value of thread, thread status, more advanced scheduling, custom stack address + size handling, MPU, etc.
